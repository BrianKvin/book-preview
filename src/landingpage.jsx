        <h2>Breaking The Poverty Bond in Africa</h2>
        <p>
          Is it possible to end poverty in all its forms, everywhere? Well, the
          book ‘Breaking the Poverty Bond in Africa’ provides a narrative of
          resilience within anxiety, hope entwined with struggle, and a beacon
          of change waiting to be ignited.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 1: Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In the heart of Africa there is an experience that has not lost
          relevance to the present day; that of tough, forceful endurance of the
          young by the young – so forceful that it includes the hope which is as
          much a part of their lives as the struggle. As the continent that
          possesses a bragging right to some of the most valuable resources in
          the world and a civilization as old as that of any other civilization
          in the world, Africa continues to be chained by the unchanging
          poverty. However, there is always a positive outlook within the
          pessimistic outlook of the Narnian people by finding the silver
          lining, the hope that is hidden in the darkness and just waiting to be
          lit up.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 2: Philanthropy at its Core</h3>
        <p>
          It is worth noting the essence of philanthropy as a strong pull for
          the fight against poverty with special reference to Africa. Whether
          through global bureaucracies such as international aid establishments
          or through grassroots efforts and charitable organizations, the
          difference made through giving builds itself through infrastructure,
          support systems, and access to resources that help communities through
          hard times. However, to lay the poverty curse, philanthropy has to
          progress into empowering development that builds up capacities of the
          leaders or the targeted communities.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 3: Education Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Educational enlightenment alway remains the pinnacle of advancement
          which he or she needs to break loose from the poverty cycle. Across
          the continent, efforts are being made towards fixing up the education
          system to provide all round quality education inclusive of teaching
          strategies. Although there is evidence of a progressive change, the
          systemic problems remain, starting with the lack of physical
          infrastructure and including the inequality of access to resources.
          The poverty cycle must be burst by addressing education in its
          totality which should foster thinking skills, imagination, Education
          for Effective Learning.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 4: Leadership and Politics.</h3>
        <p>
          Poverty remains relatively prominent in Africa today due to leadership
          and politics. Strong policy that depends upon having good governance;
          especially in relation to the need for sensible policy, for
          accountable or responsive policy, and for policy that is rational,
          proper policy, policy that is proper or appropriate or relevant policy
          – has laid down the right direction to build up a foundation for
          economic growth and social justice. Instead, corruption, political
          instability and managerial misappropriation bring in cycles of poverty
          and doom thereby robbing off people’s confidence and hampering
          innovation. To break the poverty-bond, there must be innovations
          supported by leadership that seeks to be an instrument for the
          betterment of all citizens.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 5: Breaking The Poverty Bond in Africa</h3>
        <p>
          To overcome the poverty line within the African continent requires an
          integration of actions therefore to foster change. There’s the need to
          ensure that philanthropic activities are in line with the needs and
          demands of cultures, change proactively the education systems for
          development of the successive generations positively, ethical
          leadership and governance accountability. It calls for creativity,
          endurance, and cooperation beyond the national and political section.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapter 6 Conclusion: The Ratifications and Call to Action</h3>
        <p>
          In as much as poverty in Africa is a subject full of complexities, let
          us arise and champion the cause. It is now high time for all
          philanthropists to use the right causes and join hands to rebuild the
          communities, redesign the education system for each kid to unleash his
          or her full potential, and bring the world leaders on their knees to
          work for the common good of humanity. In unison, let us pay the price
          to free ourselves from the poverty trap and create a world where the
          African shall not be denied his or her rightful place of destiny as a
          proud, prosperous and self-reliant individual.

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            Having been brought up from a humble background. Growing in one of
            the poorest and deserving communities in Homa-Bay County, this
            became my source of inspiration to initiate a program for our
            vulnerable youths. I have never wished for our youths to pursue the
            same challenges and rough challenges I faced while going through my
            academic journey. I said to myself I would use my knowledge,
            exposures and the connections around me to start something for our
            vulnerable youths from all walks of life. As a founder and the
            manager of B&J GLOBAL AUTO GARAGE LTD, I wanted to have my company
            do a youth engagement and empowerment project as its corporate
            social responsibility. Since this could not work well for me, I
            decided to brainstorm, collaborate with others to start a distinct
            and a community-based organization that specifically dealt with the
            matter Youth Engagement and Empowerment program. We started a CBO
            named Global Agency for Community Acceleration, GACA. The
            organizational mission is to mobilize in and out of school young
            people in Homa-Bay county of Kenya, assist them to get organized
            within youth associates/groups/cooperatives, assist them get social,
            entrepreneurial and development skills through training, sharing and
            exchange programs and finally equip them with community capacity
            through community outreaches. GACA's vision is to have
            well-equipped, empowered and progressive youths actively
            participating in their communities’ development. The organizational
            activities include; art-preneurship initiatives, community outreach
            activities(PSDT), Adventurers Educational clubs, Youth engagement
            training and forum, and finally have a youth exchange program and
            festival.
